    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the `remotemanager` library. Previously, we have seen how PyBigDFT can be useful for setting up and running BigDFT calculations. Unfortunately, most calculations we want to run are too computationally demanding for your workstation. This isn't limited to BigDFT runs: you may want to easily access a more powerful machine for pre/post-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `remotemanager` library is designed with this in mind. What `remotemanager` does it allows you to run any python function you define on a remote computer. This will allow you to easily mix the interactive experience of your Jupyter notebook with the power of a supercomputer."
