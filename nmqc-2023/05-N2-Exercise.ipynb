    "Change the values of the *hgrid* and *crmult* to find the converged values. Note that a thorough description of those two (essential) parameters is provided later on when studying a [CH4 molecule](https://l_sim.gitlab.io/bigdft-suite/tutorials/CH4.html).\n",

    "Note that, both in the LDA and in the HF calculation, a norm-conserving PSP is used.\n",

    "The results depends, of course, on the precision chosen for the calculation, and of the presence of the pseudopotential.\n",
    "As it is well-known, the pseudopotential appoximation is however much less severe than the approximation induced by typical XC functionals. We might see that, even in the HF case, the presence of a LDA-based pseudopotential (of rather good quality) does not alter so much the results. \n",
