    "Daubechies Wavelets is a systematic basis set (as plane waves are), which means than one can increase arbitrarily the accuracy of the results by varying some parameters which are defined in the `dft` dictionary (`inp['dft']`).\n",

    "\n",
    "**`hgrids`**\n",
    "      are used to set up the basis set. In free boundary conditions, the basis set is characterised\n",
    "      by a spatial expansion and a grid step, as shown in the side figure.\n",
    "      There is ''one float value'' describing the ''grid steps'' in the three space directions (''i.e.'' x, y and z)\n",
    "      or a 3D array is also accepted.\n",
    "      These values are in bohr unit and typically range from 0.3 to 0.65. The\n",
    "      harder the pseudo-potential, the lower value should be set up.\n",
    "      These values are called `hgrids` in the input dictionary, and can be set by the `set_hgrid` method of the \n",
    "      `Inpufile` class.\n",

    "      The first factor is the most important since it\n",
    "      describes ''the spatial expansion'' of the basis set (in yellow on the figure beside).\n",
    "      Indeed the basis set is defined as a set of real space points with non-zero values.\n",
    "      These points are on a global regular mesh and located inside spheres centered on atoms.\n",
    "      The first multiplying factor is called `crmult` for Coarse grid Radius MULTiplier.\n",
    "      Increasing it means that further spatial expansion is possible for the wavefunctions. \n",
    "      Typical values are 5 to 7.\n",
    "      The second one called `frmult` for Fine grid Radius MULTiplier is related to the fine resolution.\n",
    "      This parameter is less pertinent for the convergence of energy and can be ignored.\n",
    "      It is possible to indicate only one float value, the `crmult` parameter.\n",

    "Let us run BigDFT for the following values of *hgrid* and *crmult* and plot the total energy convergence versus `hgrids`. \n",
