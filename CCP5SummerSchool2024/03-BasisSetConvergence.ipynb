    "\n",
    "**`hgrids`**\n",
    "      are used to set up the basis set. In free boundary conditions, the basis set is characterised\n",
    "      by a spatial expansion and a grid step, as shown in the side figure.\n",
    "      There is ''one float value'' describing the ''grid steps'' in the three space directions (''i.e.'' x, y and z)\n",
    "      or a 3D array is also accepted.\n",
    "      These values are in bohr unit and typically range from 0.3 to 0.65. The\n",
    "      harder the pseudo-potential, the lower value should be set up.\n",
    "      These values are called `hgrids` in the input dictionary, and can be set by the `set_hgrid` method of the \n",

    "      Indeed the basis set is defined as a set of real space points with non-zero values.\n",
