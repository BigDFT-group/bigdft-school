# BigDFT School project.

This project contans the material for training about BigDFT code which could be execute via Google colab.
There are multiple ways to run these notebooks. You have to open a google colab session and Start by the Installation tutorial.

To do that:

 1. Go here with your google account: https://colab.research.google.com/
 2. File-> Open Notebook - > GitHub
 3. `BigDFT-group/bigdft-school`
 4. Start from the Notebook `0.Installation.ipynb`

**Alternative method (for colab experts):** It is also possible to open this project from a GitHub fork. To do this it would be enough to open one of the notebooks in the github page of 
your fork and replace `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com` in the url page. With this technique it would be possible to push your notebooks into a suitable branch of the github fork.
