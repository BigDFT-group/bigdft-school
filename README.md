# BigDFT School project.

This project contans the material for training about BigDFT code which could be execute via Google colab.
There are multiple ways to run these notebooks. You have to open a google colab session and Start by the Installation tutorial.

To do that:

 1. Go here with your google account: https://colab.research.google.com/
 2. File-> Open Notebook - > GitHub
 3. `BigDFT-group/bigdft-school`
 4. Start from the first Notebook of the chosen directory.

**Alternative method (for colab experts):** It is also possible to open this project from a GitHub fork. To do this it would be enough to open one of the notebooks in the github page of 
your fork and replace `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com` in the url page. With this technique it would be possible to push your notebooks into a suitable branch of the github fork.

Such notebooks can also be executed on a local workstation with the bigdft-client installed.
The installation can be performed by running the command

``
pip install pybigdft pyfutile py3dmol remotemanager
``

In case you do not have a jupyter notebook environment installed on your workstation, you can issue the command:

``
pip install jupyterlab py3dmol seaborn
``

The notebook can also run on a colab session, with the run data imported.

Here follow the programs of the Schools that can have been done with this material
